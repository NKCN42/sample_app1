Static directory:
1) public directory
2) rails stack

Flow goes from web browser to router to controller
URL has model of classname/method
This causes the controller to render a view and respond.

This is the rails stack.

We could make regular HTML files here, but we won't do that.

Last time, we used "rails generate scaffold" to generate code for a rails resource, 
following the REST configuration, generating an object, data relating to that object and uses a database.
If scaffold, it is comprehensive.

However, for this one, we don't really need the whole shebang. 

Typically, there's a model and a database (model connected to db and connected to and from the controller,
but due to the static web page deal, we really don't need it).
So, instead we just generate a controller.
"rails generate controller Pages home contact"
generates a controller named Pages with methods named home and contact
As said earlier, this has the url of classname/method, meaning that localhost:3000/pages/home displays home.html.erb
